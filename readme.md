Without any deep analysis, there seem to be three user level application functions:
1. A Tracking Query that can access past and present handling of a particular cargo.
2. A Booking application that allows a new Cargo to be registered and prepares the
system for it.
3. An Incident Logging application that can record each handling of the cargo (providing
the information that is found by the Tracking Query)

Later in the book:
The Activity Logging Application needs to allow the user to look up the Carrier Movement
that a Cargo is being loaded onto
