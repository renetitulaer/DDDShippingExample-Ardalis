Notes:
- how about boundaries?
- which system are we modelling?
- is it for the one who sold a product? In that case the customer is the buyer. For example a consumer who buys at bol.com
- is it for a company which does the delvery like PostNL? In that case the customer could be bol.com
- let's assume it's bol.com and the customer is a consumer
- probably bol.com has a CRM application which holds the customer
- when an order is made, the order system management will be used
- shipping the order could be a responsiblity for logistics
- let's assume the context is a logistics system
- in that case customer will be managed somewhere else
- customer is very complex in that system
- but in our domain we only need to know the customer id
- we only need to query the CRM system. We will not create customer
- TODO: make it a query service
