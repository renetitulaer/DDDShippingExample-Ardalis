From the blue book:
Handling Event and Carrier Movement: We care about such individual incidents
because they allow us to keep track of what is going on. They reflect real-world events,
and those are not usually interchangeable, so they are ENTITIES. Each Carrier Movement
will be identified by a code obtained from a shipping schedule.

Notes
- probably this is in another boundary, like CRM
- check the apps in scope in the app layer: no CRM
