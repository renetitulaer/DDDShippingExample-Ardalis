From the blue book:
Customer: Let’s start with an easy one. A customer is a person or a company, an entity
in the usual sense of the word, and it clearly has identity that matters to the user, making it
an ENTITY in the model. How to track it? Tax ID might be appropriate in some cases, but an
international company could not use that. This calls for consultation with a domain expert.
We discuss the problem with a business person in the shipping company and discover that
the company already has a customer database in which each customer is assigned an id
number at first sales contact. This id is already used throughout the company, and using
number in our software will establish continuity of identity between those systems. It will
initially be a manual entry.
